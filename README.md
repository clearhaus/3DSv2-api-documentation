# Clearhaus 3-D Secure v2 API Documentation

This is the documentation for the 3dsecure.io 3-D Secure Server.

## Status

The service and sandbox are production ready and live.

The documentation is subject to changes because of

1. The practicality of authentications differ from scheme to scheme
2. The minutiae of a complex specification
