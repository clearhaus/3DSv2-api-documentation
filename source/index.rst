This is the documentation for the 3-D Secure Server provided by `3dsecure.io`_.
It is a Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation, offering a language-agnostic
HTTP API integration. This service supports all active versions of 3-D Secure version 2
(``2.1.0``, ``2.2.0``) and our goal was to make the documentation work on it’s own.
Nevertheless, you may need to refer to the specifications during the implementation.

A 3-D Secure Server is used for *cardholder authentication*. An authentication
in 3-D Secure, is the process of verifying cardholder involvement in e.g. a
purchase. An authentication results from an *authentication flow* and proof of
authentication is an *authentication value*.  Get an overview of a 3-D Secure
Server in :ref:`what-is-a-3-d-secure-server`

What is a 3-D Secure Server?
============================

A 3-D Secure Server is used in the financial industry, to facilitate cardholder
authentication in preparation for e.g. making a purchase. The specification is
developed by EMVCo, who by `their own
words <https://www.emvco.com/about/overview/>`_:

    EMVCo exists to facilitate worldwide interoperability and acceptance of
    secure payment transactions

The specification is public and can be found at `EMVCo's document page
<https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/>`_.  The specifications are
included here for ease of access. This guide intends to be self-contained, such
that you do not need to refer to the specification.
